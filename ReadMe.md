# Market Basket Analysis

## Introduction
This script performs market basket analysis using the FP-Growth algorithm. It analyzes a dataset of groceries to discover patterns and associations between items frequently purchased together.

## Setup

```markdown
# Setting up Virtual Environment in VS Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code and want to create a virtual environment, follow these steps based on your operating system:

## macOS/Linux

You may need to run the following command first if you are using a Debian-based OS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Then, create a virtual environment by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

## Windows

You can also use the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

## Installation

After creating the virtual environment, proceed with the following step to install the necessary packages:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
This command will install the required packages for your project within the virtual environment.

```

Before running the analysis, ensure the required libraries are installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `mlxtend`
- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`

```bash
pip install numpy pandas mlxtend matplotlib wordcloud
```



```python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import fpgrowth, association_rules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

## Reading the Dataset
The script reads the dataset from an Excel file and displays its size:

```python
df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\Market-Basket-Analysis-main\groceries.xlsx', header=None)
nRow, nCol = df.shape
print(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')
```

## Data Preparation
- NaN values are filled in the dataset.
- Unique items are identified and encoded for further analysis.

```python
df.fillna(0)
items = df[0].unique()
encoded_vals = []
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    # Encoding values
```

## Frequent Itemset Mining
The FP-Growth algorithm is used to mine frequent itemsets:

```python
boolean_df = encod_df.astype(bool)
freq_items = fpgrowth(boolean_df, min_support=0.005, use_colnames=True)
```

## Visualizing Results
- The top 15 most frequent items are plotted.
- Association rules based on confidence are generated.
- A word cloud is created for visualizing the most popular items.

```python
most_popular_items = freq_items.sort_values('support', ascending=False).head(15)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 10)
most_popular_items.plot.bar('itemsets', 'support', color='Orange')
# Plotting other visualizations
```

## Exporting Results
The results, including association rules, are exported to an Excel file named `Display.xlsx`:

```python
try:
    with pd.ExcelWriter('Display.xlsx') as writer:
        # Writing to Excel file
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

## Additional Analysis
Additional association rules are generated based on different metrics such as confidence, support, and lift.

```python
a_confi_top = association_rules(freq_items, metric='confidence', min_threshold=0.2).sort_values('confidence', ascending=False).head(10)
a_supp_top = association_rules(freq_items, metric='support', min_threshold=0.05).sort_values('support', ascending=False).head()
a_lift_top = association_rules(freq_items, metric='lift', min_threshold=3).sort_values('lift', ascending=False).head(20)
```

This script provides insights into item associations and can be used for optimizing product placement or cross-selling strategies.
